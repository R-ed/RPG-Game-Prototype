Terrain map:
Blue = Tundra (presence of very sparse plant life, normally in the forms of lichens, mosses, and very hardy shrubs, little to no tree cover, cool summer temperatures, frigid winter temperatures, low soil fertility, and low precipitation - compare to the northern reaches of Siberia, Canada, Alaska, and Lappland)
Dark green = Taiga (presence of coniferous evergreen trees, mild summer temperatures, very cold winter temperatures, and high precipitation - compare to Siberia, the Canadian Shield, or northern Scandinavia)
Very dark green = Swampland (characterized by the presence of slow-moving or stagnant bodies of water, presence of aquatic vegetation in addition to shrubs and biome-dependent trees, warm to mild summer temperatures, cool to very cold winter temperatures, and high precipitation - compare to the Pripet or Tigris-Euphrates Marshes and Irish or Northern Canadian bogs)
Light green = Temperate deciduous forest (presence of deciduous broadleaf trees, warm summer temperatures, cold winter temperatures, high soil fertility and high precipitation - compare to eastern North America, Europe, and mainland East Asia)
Red = Mediterranean (presence of small shrubs and little tree cover, hot summer temperatures, cool winter temperatures, medium to low soil fertility, and medium to low precipitation - compare to the California Coast or the actual Mediterranean Coast)
Gray = Highlands (characterized by rocky, infertile soil and sparse plant life, especially in high mountains - mountains also tend to create “micro-climates” because they can be obstructive to wind currents and cloud formations)
Light yellow = Temperate grassland (presence of vast , flat plains of grass (perhaps rolling hills where mountains are present), little tree cover, warm summer temperatures, cold winter temperatures, medium soil fertility, and medium to low precipitation - compare to the Eurasian Steppe or the North American Prairie)
Gold = Tropical grassland (presence of tall grass and some tree cover (esp. acacia trees), hot summer temperatures, warm winter temperatures, and low precipitation - compare to the African Savannah or Pampas region of Argentina)
Orange = Desert (little to no vegetation present, extremely high temperatures year round, and low to no precipitation - compare to the Sahara or Arabian deserts)
Black line = mountain range
Blue line = river
Red or orange X = volcano
