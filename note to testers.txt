To testers: the actual full prototype is in the 'RPG Prototype - dplmcy' folder. You won't need to go through the contents of 'RPG Prototype - combat' and 'RPG Prototype - Stealth', since the former was just a place to test the combat system (worked into 'dplmcy' now) and the latter turned out to be unworkable.

Furthermore, you'll need to download the RPGMaker VX Ace RTP to play the prototype (and the alpha & beta once we get there). You can download it here: http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/download/additional/run-time-packages
